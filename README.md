# Magic Match

This is a image matching game developed in `React JS`. This game lets you match images with one another. The goal is toÂ flip two cards to see the image underneath and if they match, they stay flipped, if they don't match, then they turn back over. The game keeps a counter of the number of chances you take to finish the game. And you can restart at anytime by clicking a restart button, that resets the counter and reshuffles the images.
